# Coding Exercises

My solutions to "Cracking the Coding Interview". 

Primarily written in python 3.
Hopefully in time I'll add solutions in other languages, as I go along and experiment with new ones.

I include the different solutions I come up with, including those that are not optimal. 
So if you see multiple versions, it's just me trying different things.

Also comes with too much comments and random remarks.
